# GraphQL Integration Spike Document with Apollo Client - Implementation (Using Suspend Functions)

## Objective
The objective of this spike is to investigate and evaluate the feasibility of integrating GraphQL with the Apollo Client into our Android application. Apollo Client is a widely used library for handling GraphQL queries and mutations in the Android ecosystem. We want to determine if it's a suitable technology for our project.

## Tasks
1. **Research GraphQL and Apollo Client**:
    - Understand the basics of GraphQL, including queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
    - Research the benefits and potential drawbacks of using Apollo Client for Android.
    - Explore the features, community support, and documentation of Apollo Client.

2. **Choose a GraphQL Schema**:
    - Analyze the existing GraphQL schema of our server or the server we plan to use.
    - Identify the data types, queries, and mutations that our app will need to interact with the server.

   ```graphql
   type User {
     id: ID!
     username: String!
     email: String!
     # You may include other user-related fields here
     token: String
   }

   type AuthPayload {
     token: String
     user: User
   }

   type Query {
     # Query to retrieve information about the currently authenticated user
     me: User
     users: [User]
   }

   type Mutation {
     # Mutation for user registration
     register(username: String!, email: String!, password: String!): AuthPayload

     # Mutation for user login
     login(email: String!): User

     loginWithOTP(mobile: String!, countryCode: String!): AuthPayload

     loginWithToken(email: String, password: String!): AuthPayload
   }

   schema {
     query: Query
     mutation: Mutation
   }
   ```

3. **Create a Sample Android Project**:
    - Set up a new Android project or use an existing one for the spike.
    - Integrate the Apollo Client library into the project.

4. **Query and Mutation Implementation**:
    - Implement GraphQL operations using Apollo Client with `suspend` functions.

   ```kotlin
   suspend fun login(email: String): LoginMutation.Data? {
       val response = try {
           apolloClient.mutate(LoginMutation(email = email)).execute()
       } catch (e: ApolloException) {
           throw e
       }
       if (response.hasErrors()) {
           Log.w("Login", "Failed to login: ${response.errors?.get(0)?.message}")
       }
       Log.e("TAG", "loginWithToken: " + response.data?.login?.token)
       return response.data
   }
   ```

5. **Subscription Implementation**:
    - If real-time updates are required, explore how to implement GraphQL subscriptions using Apollo Client (implementation depends on your server's subscription support).

6. **Error Handling and Data Validation**:
    - Utilize Apollo Client's built-in error handling mechanisms with `suspend` functions.
    - Implement client-side data validation to ensure only valid requests are sent to the server.

7. **Performance Evaluation**:
    - Measure the performance of GraphQL queries and mutations using Apollo Client with `suspend` functions.
    - Compare the performance with traditional REST API calls.
    - Identify any potential performance bottlenecks or advantages.

8. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing**:
    - Document the integration process, including code samples with `suspend` functions and configuration details.
    - Share knowledge with the development team through a presentation or documentation.

## Challenges
- Learning curve: Developers may need to familiarize themselves with Apollo Client and GraphQL concepts.
- Schema design: The quality of the GraphQL schema and queries can significantly impact the success of the integration.
- Real-time updates: Implementing GraphQL subscriptions may require additional effort and coordination with the server.

## Potential Solutions
- Provide training and resources for developers to learn Apollo Client and GraphQL effectively.
- Collaborate closely with server-side developers to design a well-structured GraphQL schema.
- Consider third-party services for real-time updates (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging) if the GraphQL server does not support subscriptions.

## Conclusion
The GraphQL integration spike with Apollo Client using `suspend` functions has shown promising results in terms of flexibility and efficiency. The chosen GraphQL client library, Apollo Client, is well-suited for our Android application. While there are challenges to overcome, the benefits of using GraphQL and Apollo Client warrant further exploration and potential integration into our project.
